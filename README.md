## Working in this repo:

Due to the small number of teams members, we will keep our branching strategy simple. 

The main branch can be checked out to a locally named branch.  

Pull requests can be raised directly against the main branch on github. 

Commits must include a brief description of the changes made.  

PRs must include a description what  has changed, what may be missing, and any testing carried out. PRs should must be merged with the branch HEAD before being raised.  

Work will be divided to avoid too many team members working on the same area of code at once. 

If you are working on code you should commit your changes when done. 

# TODO:

* add a Makefile for format, check and test. 
> black - git hook?
> safety
